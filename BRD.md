## Project Overview

**Project Name:** PromptEVL

**Purpose of the Application:**  
"promptEVL enables users to practice real-world prompt engineering challenges and receive structured, LLM-driven evaluations. The platform helps individuals systematically develop and measure their prompt-writing skills over time."

**Problem It Solves:**  
Prompt engineering has become a critical skill with the rise of Large Language Models, but learners and organizations lack a standardized way to practice prompts, receive objective feedback, and measure skill progression.

## Scope of the Application

Application Scope Includes:

- User authentication and role-based access
- Real-world prompt engineering problems categorized by difficulty
- LLM-based evaluation of user-written prompts
- Scoring, grading, and feedback generation
- User dashboard for tracking progress and skill improvement

Scope Boundaries:

- Focuses only on prompt writing and evaluation (not model training)
- Evaluation is rubric-driven and automated
- Enterprise features and certifications are planned for later phases
