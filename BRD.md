## Project Overview

**Project Name:** PromptEVL

**Purpose of the Application:**  
"The PromptEVL enables users to solve real-world prompt engineering problems and receive structured, LLM-based evaluation. It helps individuals build measurable prompt skills"

**Problem It Solves:**  
Prompt engineering has become a critical skill with the rise of Large Language Models, but learners and organizations lack a standardized way to practice prompts, receive objective feedback, and measure skill progression.

## Scope of the Application

Application Scope Includes:

- User authentication and role-based access  

- Real-world prompt engineering problems categorized by difficulty  

- LLM-based evaluation of user-written prompts  

- Scoring, grading, and feedback generation  

- User dashboard for tracking progress and skill improvement  

Scope Boundaries:

- Focuses only on prompt writing and evaluation (not model training)  

- Evaluation is rubric-driven and automated  

- Enterprise features and certifications are planned for later phases
